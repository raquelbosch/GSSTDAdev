\title{Uniform covering. Extract intervals from filter function output
values.}
\usage{
get_intervals_One_D_uniform_covering(
  filter_values,
  num_intervals,
  percent_overlap
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filter_values}{Vector obtained after applying the filtering function
to the input matrix, i.e, a vector with the filtering function
values for each included sample.}

\item{num_intervals}{Number of intervals to divide the filtering function
values in.}

\item{percent_overlap}{Percentage of overlap between intervals.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the set of intervals for the filtering function
values.
}
\description{
It calculates the intervals of the given output values of a filter function
according to the given number and percentage of overlap. The range of filter
function values is not divided into equal parts, but each interval contains
the same number of individuals. This is done by dividing the line of
"individuals" into equal parts (with overlaps), i.e. by dividing the
individuals into equal parts after sorting them by the value of the filter
function. Subsequently, percentiles are calculated to find the extremes of
the intervals of the filter function.
